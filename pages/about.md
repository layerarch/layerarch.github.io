# What is Layer Architecture?

<strong><u>Layer Architecture</u></strong> is a Toronto-based architecture studio with an interest in designing buildings that are <strong><u>adaptable</u></strong> to changes in use, <strong><u>carbon neutral</u></strong>, and highlight the <strong><u>complex</u></strong> nature of adaptive reuse as a defining design aesthetic.

## Adaptability

Accommodate change, xix

Architecture is never finished; it continually evolves as changes in use bring new meaning to space, requiring alterations to the built form.

> "Not to include the uncertainties of use, action, and movement in the definition of architecture meant that architecture's ability to be a factor of social change was simply denied"
> 
> -- Bernard Tschumi

The failure to accommodate change in architecture has led to the premature demolition of countless monuments from the past.

The embodied energy of these lost monuments is astronomical. 

# Our Approach to Sustainability

role that adapting existing buildings can play in achiecing a more sustainable built environment, xix

Our approach to sustainability is simple:

> "The greenest building is the one that already exists"
>
> -- Carl Elphante


By examining the embodied energy of buildings—the energy used to mine, transport, refine, manufacture, and assemble materials—we gain insight into the significant CO₂ emissions associated with construction. When a building stands for over a century, the embodied energy invested in its materials is preserved. Demolishing a building and sending its debris to landfill after less than a decade of use represents a profound failure.


## Complexity... Design? 
## Design Process?

> "But an architecture of complexity and contradiction has a special obligation toward the whole: its truth must be in its totality or its implications of totality. It must embody the difficult unity of inclusion rather than the easy unity of exclusion"
>
> -- Robert Venturi





"Ultimately, none of these goals can be realized if the default response to a construction project on a site with an existing building is demolition. This mindset inspired our moniker:

> "Tabula Rasa Non Grata"

where tabula rasa—Latin for 'clean slate'—describes the common approach to development when encountering existing structures, and non grata—meaning 'no more'—represents the stance we must adopt to create a built environment worthy of future protection."





Layered architecture, which weaves historical elements into new developments, not only preserves cultural heritage but also minimizes environmental impact by reducing waste and conserving resources. It embodies the philosophy of carbon neutrality by making the most of what already exists, blending the past and future into a cohesive and sustainable narrative.

Layered Architecture: A Sustainable Vision for the Future
At Layer Architecture Inc., we believe that carbon neutrality isn’t just a goal—it’s a responsibility. Layered architecture, where remnants of the past are thoughtfully integrated with future developments, offers a powerful solution. By repurposing existing structures, materials, and histories, we create designs that are both environmentally responsible and culturally enriched.

This approach reduces waste, preserves embodied carbon in existing materials, and honors the legacy of the built environment. It allows us to balance progress with preservation, designing spaces that respect their context while adapting to contemporary needs.

From revitalizing historic buildings to blending modern interventions into existing urban fabric, our projects embody the principle that sustainable design is about more than reducing impact—it’s about creating lasting value.


Preserve the Past, Build for the Future
At Layer Architecture Inc., we transform sustainability into design by integrating remnants of the past with future-forward development. This layered approach minimizes environmental impact, preserves cultural heritage, and creates spaces that resonate with meaning and purpose.
