# How We Work 
Our process begins with a thorough understanding of the project requirements and existing conditions. For renovation and addition projects, we conduct a site visit to document existing measurements.

Once the project scope and constraints are defined, we begin the Schematic Design Phase, and develop the first draft of the floor plans, elevations, and sections. This process is highly collaborative and may involve multiple iterations until a final design is selected. We typically recommend concluding this phase by submitting a Zoning Applicable Law Certificate application to the City. 

In the Design Development Phase, structural and mechanical engineers are brought in, and the design concept is refined. While changes are still possible, they become more complex and costly as the project progresses. This phase ends with a finalized set of developed plans, including elevations, sections, and key construction details, coordinated with the various engineering disciplines.

With the final design approved, we prepare detailed construction drawings and specifications in the Construction Documents Phase. These documents serve as a guide for contractors during construction. At this stage, we also submit Building Permit applications to the City.

During the Bidding Phase, we issue a comprehensive set of construction documents to potential contractors, assist in evaluating bids, and support contract negotiations to secure the best team for your project.

Throughout the Construction Phase, we provide project oversight, ensuring compliance with the approved plans, managing changes, and maintaining quality standards. We conduct site visits, coordinate with contractors, and address any questions or challenges that arise during construction.

After completion, we offer Post-Construction Services, including final inspections, addressing deficiencies, performance reviews, and follow-ups to ensure your project meets all expectations.
