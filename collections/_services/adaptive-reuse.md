Adaptive reuse allows you to breathe new life into existing buildings, combining historical preservation with modern functionality. At Layer Architecture, we specialize in repurposing structures to serve new functions while maintaining their unique character and integrity.

## Key Offerings:
- Building Condition Assessment: Evaluating the structural and functional state of the property.
- Survey Existing Building: Detailed documentation of the current layout and features.
- Survey of Neighbours: Identifying potential impacts and opportunities with adjacent properties.
- Creation of BIM Model: Developing a 3D model to streamline design, analysis, and coordination.
- Detailed Study of Structure: Assessing the structural integrity and capacity for modifications.
- Detailed Study of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment: Evaluating existing systems for reuse, replacement, or upgrades. 

## Detailed Scope of Work:

Our approach begins with a comprehensive assessment of the existing building to identify opportunities and challenges. Using advanced tools and techniques, we create designs that honor the original structure while accommodating new uses. Whether it's converting warehouses into offices or updating historic homes, our team ensures every project meets modern performance standards without losing its character.
