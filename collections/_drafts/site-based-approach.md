# A site based approach to embodied energy

Buildings come and go, but land is forever.

A new approach to embodied energy that allocates the energy used to construct, inhabit, and demolish buildings into the land. 

Municipal zoning maps have been around for a while and are used to track and transmit information to the public such as how tall can a building be on a particular site, what occupanies (residential, commercial, industrial) can be constructed on a particular site, and how far back from the property lines must a building be. 

Therefore it is not unreasonable to consider adding an additional category that tracks the embodied energy of a site on this map or something like it. 

But just as you tally up the energy used on the land, you would also track the energy contributed to the grid through the use of solar panels, or CO2 captured and sequesterd from the environment, through the growing of trees for instance. 

explain formula

By utilising this formula here are a few scenarios to showcase how various land use scenarious would play out, and the alternaative behavior that may emerge through its use. 

Scenario #1
House constructed, total C02 used = x, demolished in 10 years, new house built, trees. 

Scenario #2
Factory constructed, emmitts major CO2 to environment, factory demolished. Land value plummits, cannot construct anything new, owner builds a forest on their land. 

The owner would have been wiser to utilise cleaner production methods, and construct their facilities with less CO2 intensive materials. 

Scenario #3
merging of two properties, one with low # one with high #
(draw little horizontal comic strip format diagrams?)

Scenario #4 
Good example, layered approach.
