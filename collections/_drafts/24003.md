The Lonsmount Addition breathes new life into a historic single-family house built in 1919, nestled in an upscale Toronto neighborhood which boats a rich housing stock of diverse architectural styles. The project showcases a commitment to durability, featuring metal tile cladding that not only adds a contemporary touch but also ensures long-lasting quality. 

The addition spans multiple levels, carefully integrating modern elements with the charm of the original structure. The ground floor hosts a grand central staircase and a new kitchen, seamlessly blending functionality and aesthetics. On the second floor, an expanded master bedroom with an ensuite and walk-in closet adds a touch of luxury and convenience to the home. 

The Lonsmount Addition is a harmonious blend of old and new, respecting the historical integrity of the original structure while introducing modern elements for contemporary living.
