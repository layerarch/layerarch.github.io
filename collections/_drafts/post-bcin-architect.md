BCIN designers are get their certificates after completing 2-3 exams which test their knowledge on building code knowledge. 
This system works because 
Municipal building departments are primarily concerned with building code requirements illustrated in the permit drawings. 
This is especially in particular for smaller scale projects. BCIN designers are in fact only permitted to design small projects of certain programs (less than 3 storeys, 600 m2 and primarily only residential)
Their fees often reflect just that, what it would take to take your design brief and turn it into a (hopefully) building code compliant set of drawings.


architect education consists of
- desigb
- space planing
- programingconstruction systems and techniques
-  and building code knowledge and life safety 
 
Architectural licensure entails 
4000 hours work experience under direct supervision of another licensed architect. (think apprenticeship)

insurance
BCIN designers are not required to cary insurance for residential projects,
Architects are legislatively mandated to cary insurance. The primary provider for insurance for Architects licensed in ontario is Prodemnity. 

What this means for fees:
It doesnt neceissarily mean BCIN designers charge less and architects charge more. 
But it does give you some questions you can ask your designer or architect. such as:
  what services do you offer.
  what will be included in your drawing package.

Many architects will offer multiple service levels: ei a simple permit set of drawings for a lesser fee vs. flly coordinate construction document package. 



POST_permit set vs cds: an dexample 
in this pos wewill explore 4 levels of architectural documentatin for a simple bathroom renovation project. ? 

level 0: the permit set

example:
Bathroom
- Permit set will show. 
plan of bathroom with overall dimensions to framing
plan of sink, toilet, tub or shower.


CDs:
- plans and elevations
- bathroom finishes
- tile: colour, size, orientation, patter, brand, model, installation piculiarities, wuality of installation, submittal requirements
wall tile, heights, same as above
tile trim
finish of tile trim
grout - colour, brand, how to mix
fixtures:
- toilet brand
- faucet type/style

level 1: elevations/patterns.

level 2: brand names/products

level 3: workmanship/ part 3 spec


grout, 

level 4:
include direction to contractors general requirements
: site logistics - where to place garbage bins. working days, working hours, schedule/milestones. areas for staging.material storage, delivery days. notices. fencing requirements. 

level 4 is being shown as the highest level of documentation but in truth this could be added ontop ofa level 1 or 2 set.
