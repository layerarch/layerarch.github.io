Kolt Investments hired us to prepare building permit drawings for their new office location on the 30th floor of an existing building in Toronto’s Yonge-Eglinton Centre. The client provided a schematic layout for the space, which I reviewed against code and fire exit requirements, making necessary adjustments. I then developed the permit drawings and assisted with the construction administration phase. The project focused on ensuring that the design was compliant with building regulations while meeting the client’s functional and aesthetic needs.
