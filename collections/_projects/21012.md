This project involved the design of a new imPerfect Fresh Eats location at the Yonge Sheppard Centre in Toronto, marking the brand's debut at this bustling urban hub. My firm transformed the existing street-level space by repurposing an existing shipping container kiosk and introducing custom-built seating and tables, updated interior finishes, and a vibrant green wall. The design aimed to create a fresh, inviting atmosphere that reflects the restaurant’s identity while optimizing functionality for high-traffic use.

The project required careful coordination and attention to detail to integrate the distinctive shipping container kiosk into the restaurant’s layout. My firm developed and oversaw the execution of design solutions that balanced aesthetic appeal with practical considerations, such as durability and efficient use of space. Custom-built benches and tables were designed to complement the industrial character of the container while providing comfortable and functional seating. The vibrant green wall was strategically placed to enhance the interior environment, serving as both a visual focal point and a reflection of the brand’s sustainability ethos.
