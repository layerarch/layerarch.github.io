Built in 1862 and former home to Catherine Parr Traill, the Westove is a site of cultural significance to all of Canada and a designated heritage building. The current owners and residents of the Westove approached us to design a modern but contextually sensitive out-building to be used as a garage, barn, wine bar, and recreational space.

  The size and positioning of the new structure would be subordinate to the heritage buildings massing and location. Key characteristic features of the house were to be replicated on the barn, such as the decorative bargeboard displayed prominently on the gable end facades. To further tie in the new build, cedar shingles and white painted wood lap siding were chosen to emulate the materiality of the  heritage building.
