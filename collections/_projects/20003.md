This project involved the interior renovation of an empty commercial unit in a strip-style building for GreenHouse, a new cannabis retailer in Hamilton. My firm was tasked with designing the store’s layout, developing custom millwork and cabinetry, selecting interior finishes, and ensuring compliance with Provincial regulations governing cannabis retail operations.

The design focused on creating an inviting and professional environment that aligns with the GreenHouse brand while addressing operational needs and customer flow. Custom millwork and cabinetry were tailored to enhance functionality and display aesthetics, while carefully chosen finishes contributed to a modern and polished atmosphere. The project combined creativity with regulatory expertise, resulting in a compliant, well-executed retail space that sets the stage for a positive customer experience.
