For the Villages of Waterford, a suburban development in Hamilton, Ontario, I collaborated with a developer to design and document a series of homes tailored to the tract-style construction method. This approach required balancing cost-efficiency with aesthetic and functional appeal.

Working with the developers team of designers we created several distinct designs, each offering subtle variations in layout and facade which were then prepared for building permit submissions and construction. The variety in designs was crucial to add character to the development while maintaining the repetition and modularity necessary for large-scale construction. The homes were designed to integrate seamlessly with the planned community infrastructure, meeting both municipal and market demands.

Key considerations included optimizing designs for mass production, ensuring compliance with local building codes, and coordinating with the developer to align the designs with buyer preferences and tract construction techniques. These efforts resulted in a cohesive yet varied neighborhood that adhered to the practicalities of tract development while offering residents a sense of individuality and style.
