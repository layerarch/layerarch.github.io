The Kawartha Lakes Cottage boasts a compact interior core housing washrooms, a laundry room, mechanical space, pantry, and a fireplace. Designed for efficiency, this space maximizes functionality. Below the second-floor loft space, you'll find compact bedrooms that serve as cozy retreats, complemented by the loft's purpose as a tranquil reading area. This innovative use of space enhances the cottage's versatility and creates designated areas for relaxation. 

The heart of the cottage lies in the central kitchen paired with a great room, creating a warm haven for relaxation on chilly nights. Durable materials, including brick and standing seam metal roofing, enhance both aesthetics and resilience. A simple aesthetic with clean lines contributes to a timeless atmosphere, promoting a connection to nature. 

The cottage's solar orientation maximizes natural lighting, allowing residents to enjoy the sunset from the front porch year-round. This thoughtful design balances practicality and aesthetics, creating a harmonious living space that blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings.
