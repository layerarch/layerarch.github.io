The design inspiration for this gas fireplace enclosure with custom-built-in millwork was that of a cozy Scandivaian cabin. The 2 ½” thick solid oak shelves were crafted from solid wood timbers sourced from a local lumber mill and were installed with hidden battens achieving a floating aesthetic.

This project encompassed various design iterations and detailed renderings, providing a comprehensive visual exploration from conception to construction. In the role of a private contractor, I took charge of the construction phase, collaborating with the homeowners who provided valuable labor assistance. 

The collaborative effort aimed to seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetic appeal, transforming the fireplace into a focal point of the room.
