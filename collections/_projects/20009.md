Envisioned as the supporting structure for a natatorium in Toronto's Golden Mile neighborhood, this column cluster was designed to evoke the exuberance and playfulness reminiscent of watching someone make a giant splash into a pool. At its core, the column takes shape as a cluster of modified round HSS sections filled with concrete. This unique configuration transforms the column's center into a versatile space, serving as a lightwell, an air duct, or a passage for essential building services. The construction's ingenuity extends to the floor and roof, employing a refined steel plate system (SPS). Characterized by thin yet robust steel members intricately arranged to form a grid-like slab, this design achieves expansive spans in all directions. The result is an architectural marvel that seamlessly balances structural integrity with an aesthetically pleasing and consistent profile, defining a harmonious marriage of form and function.
