Since the 1960s the whimsical forms of Islington Station have both amazed and sheltered transit riders. The beautiful three-center arched canopy adds a certain character to the neighborhood not found in most of the new development in the area and harkens back to the bold concrete forms of Toronto’s past.

With the recent redevelopment of Kipling station (just one stop west of Islington) now taking the reins as the major bus terminal in the area, it's only a matter of time before Islington station becomes deemed under utilised, and the target for redevelopment, or in the worst case, demolition.

This hypothetical design exercise aims to transform the station into public program. By utilising the natural forms of the station I am proposing an alternate use for the structures as a gallery space once when and if this day should come. Below is a sampling of the work produced for this speculative endeavor.
