Carbon[Sync] is a proposed method for offsetting an individuals carbon output for the year by encapsulating it within this wooden wall feature. The installation also serves as a physical reminder to be more environmentally conscious with the choices we make on a day-to-day basis. 

The premise of the project is simple, every day we release carbon into the environment through our choices of transportation methods, heating sources, electricity usage, the food we eat, the products we buy, and the waste we produce. Trees store carbon naturally through a process of photosynthesis as they grow. On average one cubic meter of wood stores about 1.5 metric tonnes of carbon. 

By sustainably harvesting those trees and converting them into wood products, that carbon is effectively locked into the wood for the entirety of that products lifespan. The 8’ x 36’ panel contains a net volume of 1.0 m³ of wood, which would offset approximately 1.5t of CO2, which is about the average transportation emissions for a typical commuter driving 30 minutes a day 5 days a week for the year.
