The Lonsmount Addition breathes new life into a historic single-family house built in 1919, nestled in an upscale Toronto neighborhood which boats a rich housing stock of diverse architectural styles. The project showcases a commitment to durability, featuring metal tile cladding that not only adds a contemporary touch but also ensures long-lasting quality. 

Working colaboratively with the Owners, who supplied the initial design scheme inclusive of plans and elevations, the addition spans multiple levels, carefully integrating modern elements with the charm of the original structure. The ground floor hosts a grand central staircase and a new kitchen, seamlessly blending functionality and aesthetics. On the second floor, an expanded master bedroom with an ensuite and walk-in closet adds a touch of luxury and convenience to the home. 

The Lonsmount Addition is a harmonious blend of old and new, respecting the historical integrity of the original structure while introducing modern elements for contemporary living.
