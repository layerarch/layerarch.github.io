This gas fireplace enclosure, complemented by custom-built-in millwork, draws inspiration from the warmth and simplicity of a cozy Scandinavian cabin. The design features 2 ½-inch thick solid oak shelves, crafted from locally sourced wood timbers, and installed with hidden battens to achieve a seamless, floating aesthetic.

The project journey included multiple design iterations and detailed renderings, offering a thorough visual exploration from concept to completion. This approach ensured a harmonious balance between functionality and aesthetic appeal, making the fireplace a captivating focal point of the room.

Acting not only as the designer but also as construction manager and builder, I managed the construction phase in collaboration with the homeowners, who provided valuable labor assistance. By eliminating the need for a general contractor, we achieved significant cost savings. These savings were further enhanced through the homeowners’ contributions to demolition and labor, making this project a truly collaborative effort.
