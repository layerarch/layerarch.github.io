title: "200 Queens Quay West"
description: "This adaptive reuse proposal transforms an existing parking garage in downtown Toronto into a 730,000 square-foot mixed-use residential building. Instead of demolishing the structure, the project aims to balance development and preservation, offering a new approach to urban living that preserves the potential of older buildings while fostering community engagement. By adapting the garage’s structural grid and creating flexible, modular housing units, the design reinvents the medium-density urban experience, while respecting the surrounding environment and public space."

This adaptive reuse proposal transforms an existing parking garage in downtown Toronto into a 730,000 square-foot mixed-use residential building. Instead of demolishing the structure, the project aims to balance development and preservation, offering a new approach to urban living that preserves the potential of older buildings while fostering community engagement. By adapting the garage’s structural grid and creating flexible, modular housing units, the design reinvents the medium-density urban experience, while respecting the surrounding environment and public space.

The design optimizes the existing structure by reinforcing columns and adding new supports, allowing for an open-air interior street that accommodates both people and vehicles. The residential units, arranged within 30 feet of the building’s perimeter, feature customizable layouts using prefabricated modules. This flexible approach reduces construction costs and allows residents to participate in the build process, enhancing skills and fostering community involvement.

The ground floor includes a community workshop where residents collaborate with architects to design their units, streamlining the building process and creating opportunities for affordable, self-built homes. By preserving the building’s structural framework and integrating sustainable, adaptable design, this project offers a new model for urban living that balances growth with environmental responsibility.
