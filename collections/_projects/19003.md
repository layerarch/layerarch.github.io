This entry for the 2019 Winter Warming Huts competition was based on offering visitors an interactive experience using low tech materials. The façade of the hut offers an ever changing composition of white and black which adapts not only to ambient temperatures and sunlight, but also to heating and cooling caused by human interaction. 

This change in colour is achieved by thermochromic ink enhanced paint coating the aluminum sheet cladding. When above 14° C the paint appears white and when the surrounding temperature drops below 14° C the molecular structure of the paint changes, turning black. 

This change in colour also serves to passively regulate heat gain, by turning black when temperatures are low, the cladding draws in more heat from the sun. When temperatures rise, the cladding turns to white and reflects that heat energy from the sun. The experience for visitors, however, allowed for playful interactions through the touch of the hand, or the casting of a shadow to alter the structures appearance.

The structure is comprised of CLT panels both for the environmental benefits and ease of construction offered by the material. The 5 CLT panels have mitre cut corners so that they fit together in the easiest way possible. Upon erecting the 4 side panels and roof the only thing left to do is apply the sheathing and the structure will be complete.
