## Introduction

When planning a construction project, one of the first decisions you'll face is the level of detail your architectural drawings will provide. On one end, there’s the simple *“permit set”*—enough to obtain municipal approval. On the other end, there’s the *fully coordinated architectural services*, which includes all the details necessary for a smooth construction process.

Understanding the differences can help you balance cost, time, and quality.

## "Permit Set" of Drawings

A permit set includes the **minimum information required to secure building permits**:
* Basic layouts of rooms, elevations, and roof plans
* Essential construction details required by the building department
* Focus on code compliance, fire safety, accessibility, and life-safety requirements

**What permit sets are good for:**

1. **Tight project timelines:** Quickly submitting plans to the city to secure a permit.
2. **Small projects or owner-driven projects:** If the owner can handle finish selections and materials.
3. **Projects where aesthetics are not a priority:** Function and compliance take precedence over design finesse.

**Limitations:**

* Limited or no guidance on materials, finishes, or furniture placement
* Minimal coordination with mechanical, electrical, or plumbing systems
* Potential for construction delays or surprises due to missing details
* Greater reliance on contractor judgment for finish selections, which can affect cost and aesthetics

## Fully Coordinated Architectural Drawings 

A fully coordinated set goes far beyond permit requirements, **covering all aspects of construction and design**:
* **Material Specifications:** Product names, types, and installation requirements
* **Finish Schedules:** Room-by-room finishes with approximate quantities
* **Door and Hardware Schedules:** Sizes, types, and finishes clearly indicated
* **Cabinets and Millwork:** Detailed plans and elevations showing drawers, doors, panels, materials, and finishes
* **Coordination of MEP Systems:** Mechanical ductwork, plumbing, and electrical runs integrated into walls and ceilings to avoid bulkheads and surprises
* **Construction Documentation:** Comprehensive drawings for contractors to follow without guesswork

**Benefits:**

* Visualize finishes, furniture, and fixtures before construction begins
* Reduce costly construction errors or changes mid-project
* Streamline contractor communication and decision-making
* Account for lead times, specialized products, and procurement requirements

## Material Selection and Finishes

With a permit set:

* Contractors often select materials based on price or convenience, not your preferences
* Decisions may need to be made on-site with limited time and visual guidance
* Changes mid-construction can cause delays and additional costs

With a fully coordinated set:

* You control materials, finishes, and aesthetics from the start
* The architect coordinates selections with mechanical, plumbing, and electrical layouts
* Potential conflicts and delays are minimized

## Coordination of Services

A full architectural set ensures:

* Proper integration of mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems
* Minimization of unsightly bulkheads or conflicts
* Early identification of potential construction challenges

Permit sets do not provide this level of coordination, which may lead to on-site problem-solving and additional costs.

## Cost Considerations

Hiring an architect for a full set takes more time, which **increases fees**. However, the **cost of missing details or mistakes during construction is often much higher**. Investing in a fully coordinated set is a proactive strategy that can save both money and stress in the long run.

## Conclusion

**Permit sets** are useful for quick approvals, small projects, or when aesthetics and coordination are not critical.  

**Fully coordinated architectural sets** are essential for projects where design quality, material choices, and construction efficiency matter.  

Working with an architect to produce a full set of drawings is the best way to **avoid surprises, reduce delays, and ensure the final build reflects your vision**.
